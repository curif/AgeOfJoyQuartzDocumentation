A 3D coordinate system as a way to describe the position of objects or points in a three-dimensional space. It's like a set of directions that help us locate or position things in a 3D world.

**X, Y, and Z Axes**: In a 3D coordinate system, we have three main directions or axes: X, Y, and Z.

- X-Axis: This runs horizontally from left to right.
- Y-Axis: This runs vertically from bottom to top.
- Z-Axis: This runs from front to back, or from near to far.
