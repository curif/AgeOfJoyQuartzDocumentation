A 3D coordinate system as a way to describe the position of objects or points in a three-dimensional space. It's like a set of directions that help us locate or position things in a 3D world.

**X, Y, and Z Axes**: In a 3D coordinate system, we have three main directions or axes: X, Y, and Z.

- X-Axis: This runs horizontally from left to right.
- Y-Axis: This runs vertically from bottom to top.
- Z-Axis: This runs from front to back, or from near to far.

In 3D space, there are two distinct reference systems:

1. Local: This pertains specifically to cabinets, with the 3D spatial metrics centered around the cabinet itself. For instance, when we say x=1, it indicates a distance of one unit from the center of the cabinet, rather than from the global origin point.

2. Global: This references the entire world. Measurements and coordinates within this system are in relation to the world's center, providing a broader context beyond individual cabinets.

If you are working with cabinet's parts is better to use the `local` functions.
