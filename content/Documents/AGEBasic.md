# AGEBasic

`AGEBasic` allows the player to control some in-game behaviors by using a special version of the BASIC programming language.

The `AGEBasic` compiler and runtime engine was specifically developed for [[Age of Joy]]. It is inspired in [tiny basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_BASIC)

With `AGEBasic` the player can develop it's own functions to run in the simulation. Allows to control parts of the game that there aren't available from the [[YAML]] configuration or the [[Visual configuration]].

> [!warning] AGEBasic applies to [[Age of Joy]] in its version 0.4-RC04 or superior.
