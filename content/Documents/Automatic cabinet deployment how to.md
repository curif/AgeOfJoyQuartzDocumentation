When the player enters to any room, [[Age of Joy]] will check if all the cabinets in the room have been assigned. If there are cabinets without assignation, a process will check for cabinets not assigned yet and will assign them to the free positions (if the cabinet fits in the position).

After that, [[Age of Joy]] will distribute random selected cabinets if free positions remains.

### Step by step explanation

1. **Room Entry Trigger:** When the player enters any room in **Age of Joy**, the game triggers a cabinet assignment process.
2. **Checking Assigned Cabinets:** First, the game checks if all existing cabinets in the room have already been assigned to specific positions.
3. **Filling Empty Positions:** If there are empty cabinet positions available:
    
    - The game searches for unassigned cabinets that exist but haven't been placed yet.
    - It checks if these unassigned cabinets fit any of the empty positions (presumably based on size or type compatibility).
    - If a fit is found, the unassigned cabinet is placed in the empty position.
    
4. **Random Distribution (Optional):** If there are still empty positions remaining after step 3:
    
    - The game may choose to distribute additional cabinets from a pool of randomly selected, unassigned cabinets (if this feature is enabled).
    - Again, it's likely that compatibility checks happen to ensure these randomly chosen cabinets fit the available positions.
    

**Note:** This explanation assumes "assignation" is meant to be synonymous with "placement" or "assignment to a specific location."

### Manual assignment

The player can assign any cabinet to any position using the [[Visual configuration]] even if the cabinet don't fit.
