In AGE of Joy, one of the main challenges is to have an exact representation of the screen in each cabinet.

I want a perfect screen for each game, not only the position (horizontal and vertical) but the screen size, curvature, borders, how the light reflects in the borders, etc. And, why not? the screen failures.

Those televisions tended to fail because they were turned on 20 hours a day, you can see this kind of failures in *AGE of Joy* too. Flickering, horizontal lines, discoloration and game marks where common in the CRTs of those days.

Cabinets have a way to configure the screen damage in the [[CDL the Cabinet Description Language#Damage shader]]. You can make bright and gamma adjustments using CDL also, in the  [[CDL the Cabinet Description Language#Configuring the monitor (CRT)]] section.

If the original game shows himself inverted in the screen you can invert the X and Y coordinates.
