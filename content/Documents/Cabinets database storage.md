The Cabinets storage is a folder where [[Age of Joy]] register the cabinets to use in each room. When you upload a [[Cabinet Asset]] (the zip file), AGE will detect it and register it in the storage.

The storage is the `/sdcard/Android/data/com.curif.AgeOfJoy/cabinetsdb` folder

> [!warning] 
>Don't touch that folder unless you are sure what you are doing
