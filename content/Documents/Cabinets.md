A cabinet, in the context of old games, refers to the container or enclosure that holds the game software and data. These cabinets were physical structures, often found in arcades or gaming centers, where players could interact with the game.

In the virtual realm of AGE, cabinets represent the digital counterparts of these physical cabinets. When you want to play a specific game, you need to download the corresponding digital cabinet file. This digital cabinet contains all the necessary game files, assets, and configurations required to run the game.

Once you have downloaded the cabinet file, you can then upload it to your Quest device. This process effectively brings the game and its associated files into your virtual gaming environment, allowing you to access and play the game within the AGE platform.
