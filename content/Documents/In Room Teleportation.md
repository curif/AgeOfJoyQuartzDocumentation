# In Room Teleportation

In order to move to a particular location within the virtual environment, the user has the ability to teleport. To initiate the teleportation process, the user needs to press the right-grip control in the Quest controller and direct a beam towards an area in the virtual environment that is capable of receiving teleportation. 

By pressing the `right-grip` control the user triggers the teleportation action. They then use the beam, to select the desired teleportation destination, holding and leaving the `right-joystick up`  the user triggers the teleportation action. The areas in the virtual environment that are suitable for teleportation are marked as teleport-capable areas. The beam change colors when hit a teleportation area.

Once the user has aimed the beam at the intended teleport-capable area and activated the teleportation action, they will be instantly transported or moved to that specific position in the virtual environment. This mechanism provides a convenient way for users to navigate and move around the virtual space by instantly jumping to different locations.

### Teleport capable areas:

- In front of a door.
- In a mark in front of any cabinet.
- Hidden in some strategic places
