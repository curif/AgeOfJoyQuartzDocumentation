In this manual, when discussing music functionality, we commonly refer to a "jukebox."

[[Age of Joy]] enables players to enjoy their music much like the experience of using a jukebox or Rockola from the 80s.

Music playback is typically managed through [[AGEBasic]], allowing [[Cabinet Artist]]s to create jukeboxes just as they create game cabinets.

Users have the option to transfer their own music files to the directory `/sdcard/Android/data/com.curif.AgeOfJoy/music`. Accepted file formats include common ones like `mp3` or `ogg`.

Given that [[AGEBasic]] is not limited to cabinets but also extends to the [[Configuration control cabinet]] and [[Room]]s (e.g., for room configuration), the possibilities are extensive. For instance, players can configure a room to play a specific album or set global music preferences for the overall experience.

For further details, please refer to the [[AGEBasic programing]] manual for functions like `Music*()`.
