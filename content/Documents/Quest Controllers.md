The *AGE of Joy* behavior differs where you are in emulation mode or in simulation mode.

* **Simulation mode**: you can walk and move inside the simulation using the primary joystick to advance and lateral movements and the secondary joystick for rotation.
* **Emulation/Game mode**: when you insert a coin and the game [[ROM]] is present you can play the game; you can no longer walk or rotate because you are using the Quest Controls to play.

To exit the Emulation Mode, grip the left control and wait some seconds, AGE of Joy returns the control movement to you, and the emulation ends.

The control scheme in Emulation Mode varies depending on the game, but it is nearly universal. Move with the **primary joystick**, shoot with **B**, perform other actions with **A**, and so on.

## How to insert a coin

In Simulation mode or Emulation mode, if you look at your left wrist, there is a coin. Take it with your right hand (holding the right grip button) and put it in the coin slot in the cabinet, the game  emulation will start (if you already upload a compatible [[ROM]]).

Later, a new coin will appear on your wrist, and you will have an infinite amount of money to spend on your favorite games!

The game perform its initialization process when the emulation starts, this is annoying because is the same process that the machine do when is turned on (it's not what you expect when you insert a coin in a machine). To avoid this problem, AGE of Joy will save the status after initialization, but this does not always work because it is dependent on the game.
