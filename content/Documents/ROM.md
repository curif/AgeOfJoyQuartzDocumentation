In [[MAME]], `ROM` stands for Read-Only Memory. It refers to the digital data containing the game code, graphics, and other assets of an arcade game that was originally stored in non-volatile memory chips on the original arcade machine's circuit board.

In order to play arcade games on MAME, you need to provide the ROM files of the respective arcade games. These ROM files contain the game data and are used by the emulator to recreate the original arcade machine's hardware environment and run the game software. MAME is designed to accurately emulate the behavior of numerous arcade systems, allowing you to play a wide variety of arcade games on your computer.

> [!warning] It's important to note that distributing or downloading copyrighted ROMs is generally illegal unless you own the original arcade machine and create your own ROM from it. It is recommended to only use ROMs for which you have proper ownership rights or obtain them from legal sources.

I you don't own ROMs you can use AGE of Joy without play any game, the experience is there anyway.

AGE of Joy is compatible with [libretro-mame2003-plus](https://github.com/libretro/mame2003-plus-libretro).
