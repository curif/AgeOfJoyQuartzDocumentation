> Available starting at v0.4

To configure the player height:

- Go to any cabinet controller 
- Change from *room configuration* to *global configuration* (refer to [[Visual configuration manual]])
- Select `PLAYER` from the main menu.
- Change the player type. The player type refers to the height of the player, "pac-man" is the shortest and "NBA Jam" is the tallest.
- Save. The height should change almost immediately, if it not suit you, change and save it again.


> [!note] Play seated: Simply select "NBA Jam" (highest) and you can play seated.
