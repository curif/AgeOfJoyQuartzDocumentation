A **shader** is a small program that runs on the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) to control how objects and surfaces appear on screen. Shaders are responsible for determining the color, lighting, textures, and other visual aspects of game objects. They can be used to create realistic effects like lighting, reflections, shadows, or more stylized visuals such as cartoon shading or special effects like fire or water.
