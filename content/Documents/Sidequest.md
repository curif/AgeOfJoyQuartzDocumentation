SideQuest is an application and platform designed specifically for the Oculus Quest and Oculus Quest 2 virtual reality (VR) headsets. It allows users to discover, download, and install a variety of unofficial VR content, including games, apps, demos, and experimental experiences.

The Oculus Quest platform has its official store called the Oculus Store, which provides a curated selection of applications approved by Oculus. However, SideQuest offers an alternative way for developers to distribute their VR creations that may not meet the requirements or guidelines of the official store.

SideQuest enables users to access a wider range of VR experiences, including early prototypes, indie games, and experimental projects. It provides a platform for developers to share their creations directly with the VR community. Users can explore and install these unofficial apps by connecting their Oculus Quest headset to a computer and using the SideQuest application.

Please note that while SideQuest is a popular platform for accessing unofficial VR content, it is important to exercise caution and only download from trusted sources. Always ensure that you are downloading content from reputable developers to avoid any potential security risks or unauthorized software.
