The concept revolves around the extraordinary ability to move instantly from one location to another within the game's virtual world. Unlike traditional forms of movement, such as walking or running, teleportation offers players the power to traverse vast distances or navigate complex environments without the constraints of physical limitations.

They can effortlessly transport themselves from one room to another, bypassing obstacles, overcoming challenges, and reaching their desired destinations in an instant.
