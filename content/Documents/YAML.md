YAML is a very simple way to document information in a way that a person can read/write it easily and a computer too; it's a good interface person-machine. Read more about YAML in [Wikipedia](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).

A YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) file is a human-readable data serialization format commonly used for configuration files and structured data storage. It is designed to be easily readable by both humans and machines, making it a popular choice for various applications and programming languages.

YAML files use indentation and a hierarchical structure to represent data. Here are some key characteristics of YAML:

1. Readability: YAML emphasizes readability and uses a straightforward syntax. It employs indentation and whitespace to define the structure of the data, making it easy for humans to understand and edit.

2. Data Structure: YAML supports different types of data, including scalars (strings, numbers, booleans), arrays (lists), and mappings (key-value pairs). These data types can be nested and combined to represent complex structures.

3. Hierarchy: YAML uses indentation to define the hierarchical relationships between elements. Indentation is typically done with spaces (not tabs), and the number of spaces per level is consistent throughout the file.

4. Comments: YAML allows comments, denoted by the "#" symbol, to provide explanatory notes or annotations within the file. Comments are ignored by the parser and do not affect the data.

5. Portability: YAML is a language-agnostic format, meaning it can be used with various programming languages and platforms. Libraries and parsers are available for different programming languages, enabling easy integration and data exchange.

6. Integration: YAML is commonly used for configuration files in applications and systems. It provides a flexible and readable way to define settings, options, and parameters that control the behavior of the application.

YAML files can be edited with any plain text editor, and their structure and syntax make them well-suited for version control systems. They are often used in web development, DevOps, automation, and other scenarios where human-readable and machine-parseable configuration or data representation is required.

Overall, YAML offers a convenient and flexible format for storing and exchanging structured data in a readable and intuitive manner.
