# AGE of Joy

If you don't know what AGE of Joy is please follow [this link](https://curifab.itch.io/age-of-joy) for information.

## Documentation

AGE of Joy require some work to start. I suggest to read the [[AGE FAQ]] and the [[Documentation]]. 

## Cabinets

### Packs

A cabinet pack is a group of cabinets packed for distribution. You can read in [[How to get and deploy cabinets assets]] about the installation in your Quest. You can also read the [[Short guide to make cabinets]]  if you can't find what you need.

Access to the cabinets [[packs]]


> [!note] There are many cabinets created by the community that are not mentioned or listed here. To access them, you can join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/b83ykCM9Xp)  server. However, it's important to note that discovering these additional cabinets may require some effort on your part. You will need to search through message groups to find the latest and newly shared cabinets.

In December of 2023, the [[Discord server]] already pass the goal of surpassing *500* cabinets!!!! the count is still growing!

## About [[ROM]]s

> [!warning]  üëÆüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ROMs are digital copies of copyrighted material, such as games, and are protected by intellectual property laws. It is important to be aware of this and respect the legal rights of copyright holders. Distributing ROMs or engaging in any form of illegal sharing of copyrighted material is strictly prohibited.
I would advise you not to inquire about or seek guidance on where to find ROMs or engage in any activities that infringe upon copyright laws. It is always best to obtain games and other copyrighted content through legal means, such as purchasing them from authorized sources.

If you have a question about a [[ROM]] or a problem with a rom please post a question in [Discord](https://discord.gg/b83ykCM9Xp)

AGE of Joy uses [[MAME]]. [[ROM]]s that are compatible with the [[MAME#Cores]] libretro version should work. However, there are differences and compatibility issues in the implementation in AGE of Joy: some game picture formats don‚Äôt work, sound issues, performance, etc. can affect the correct ROM behavior. There are a _[MAME 2003-Plus Reference: Full Non-Merged Romsets](https://www.google.com/search?q=MAME+2003-Plus+Reference%3A+Full+Non-Merged+Romsets&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)_ on internet for your information

To confirm if your ROM is the same used to test the game use [this tool](https://curif.github.io/AgeOfJoy-ROMCRC/index.html) üëàüèº please compare yours with the `MD5 hash` information in the game page in this site.

If a game you own is not listed, it does not mean that the game cannot run. It simply has not been tested or there is no cabinet to hold it.
